### Info

Me and 2 other students created an android app via Java and Android sdk. It uses firebase to store and retrieve location data/posts.

The app allows you to take a picture of a dog you see. People in the area will get a notification, and can view it on the "map" view or on the "feed" view, which will have info/pics.
